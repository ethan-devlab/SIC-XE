# SIC/XE Assembly Project
This is a SIC/XE Assembly language project and is named BFS-BubbleSort. <br>
The program will do BFS traversal first and do Bubble Sort afterwards.
* Author: Ethan-DevLab, 2025
## To compile
```
java -cp out/make/sictools.jar sic.Asm bfs-bubblesort.asm
```

## To run
```
java -jar out/make/sictools.jar bfs-bubblesort.asm
```
The result will be output to Terminal/CMD

## Example
See **result1.png** and **result2.png**

## Note
* THIS IS A DEMO OF BFS TRAVERSAL COMBINED WITH BUBBLE SORT
* THE DEFAULT SOURCE VERTEX IS 0
* THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF VERTEX IS 10
* THE CAPABILITY OF NUMBER PROCESSING IS THE NUMBER LESS THAN 10
* ADDRESS OF OUTPUT DEVICE IS X'01'
